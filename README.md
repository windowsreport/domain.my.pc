## What is a Domain?

Windows domains provide network administrators with a way to manage a large number of PCs and control them from one place. One or more servers — known as domain controllers — have control over the domain and the computers on it.

Domains are generally made up of computers on the same local network. However, computers joined to a domain can continue communicating with their domain controller over VPN or Internet connection. This allows businesses and schools to remotely manage laptops they provide to their employees and students.

When a computer is joined to a domain, it doesn’t use its own local user accounts. User accounts and passwords are managed on the domain controller. When you log into a computer on that domain, the computer authenticates your user account name and password with the domain controller. This means you can log in with the same username and password on any computer joined to the domain.

## Is My Computer Part of a Domain?

If you have a home computer, it’s almost certainly not part of a domain. You could set up a a domain controller at home, but there’s no reason to do this unless you really want the experience. If you use a computer at work or school, there’s a good chance your computer is part of a domain. If you have a laptop provided to you by your work or school, it may also be part of a domain.

You can quickly check whether your computer is part of a domain or not. Open the Control Panel, click the System and Security category, and click System. Look under “Computer name, domain and workgroup settings” here. If you see “Domain”: followed by the name of a domain, your computer is joined to a domain.

## How Do You Know If Your Computer Is on a Domain?

If you have a home computer, it's very unlikely you're on a domain. You could create a domain on your home network, but there's not much use to doing so. But if you use a computer supplied by your work or school, it's almost certainly on a domain.

To check if your computer is part of a domain, open the Control Panel and click the System entry. Look under the Computer name section. If you see a Workgroup entry with WORKGROUP (the default) or another name listed, your computer is not on a domain. Likewise, if you see Domain here, then your computer is on a domain.
